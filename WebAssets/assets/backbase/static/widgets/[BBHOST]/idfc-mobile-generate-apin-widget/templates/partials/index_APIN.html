                        is to be paid by the Bank in lump sum at the time of maturity, the Term/Fixed Deposit shall bear the yearly rate of
                        interest on the Term/Fixed Deposit. <br>
                        (c) The Bank may announce special rates for senior citizens and staff. <br>
                        (d) Methodology of interest calculation <br>
                        (e) Interest rates are money market (i.e. simple interest) rates for tenors upto 6 months and quarterly compounded
                        rates for tenors of 6 months and above. However, in case of Traditional Term/Fixed Deposits interest rates are money
                        market (i.e. simple interest) rates irrespective of the tenor. <br>
                        14.15 The method of calculation on interest on a Term/Fixed Deposit, both Traditional and Cumulative deposits
                        is as under: <br>
                        14.16 For Traditional Term/Fixed Deposits with quarterly payouts interest is calculated based on annual rates
                        (simple interest). However, in case of monthly payouts, interest is paid at a discounted value. For Traditional
                        Term/Fixed Deposits with quarterly
                        payout, interest is calculated on the principal amount for completed quarters and then for the balance period,
                        interest is calculated for completed months and further for incomplete month on actual number of days.
                        <br>
                        14.17 For Cumulative Term/Fixed Deposits, interest is compounded quarterly on completion of exact quarters.
                        For the broken period beyond completed quarters, simple interest is calculated on the cumulated deposit amount for
                        remaining number of days. <br>
                        14.18 In case of premature withdrawal the interest is calculated on the principal amount for completed quarters
                        and then for the balance period, interest is calculated for completed months and further for incomplete month on
                        actual number of days. <br>
                        14.19 For the purpose of interest calculation calendar year is taken to consist of 365 days irrespective of
                        whether it is a leap year. <br>
                        14.20 Renewal: In the absence of any special instructions, the deposit will be renewed on maturity for a like term at
                        the then applicable interest rates. <br>
                        14.21 Tax Deduction at Source: Tax is deducted at source on interest on Term/Fixed Deposit held by the resident if
                        the interest paid or payable by the branch for the financial year exceeds the threshold limit specified by Income
                        Tax Act, 1961. Currently, the threshold limit for this purpose is Rs. 10,000 p.a.<br>
                        14.22 For Traditional FD (with quarterly / monthly interest payment), tax is deducted on each interest payment and on interest accrued on March 31st of every year. For Cumulative FD, tax is deducted on interest accrued on March 31st of every year and on
                        maturity. The TDS amount calculated on the accrued interest is remitted to the tax authorities on behalf of
                        the customer by the Bank. The interest on the TDS amount from April 1st till maturity of the deposit is
                        adjusted from the interest payable to the client. <br>
                        14.23 As per provisions of Finance Act 2009, w.e.f April 01, 2010, valid PAN is required to be submitted by
                        all customers whose tax needs to be deducted. In the absence of a valid PAN, tax will be deducted at the
                        prevailing rate or 20% whichever is higher. Also, Form 11G/H shall not be treated as valid unless PAN is
                        mentioned in such forms. <br>
                        14.24 In case the deposit holder does not want the Tax to be deducted at source, they may submit Form 11G / 11H
                        (other than company, firm or co-operative society)/ Exemption Certificate under Section 197 (in case of all holders)/

                        14.25 In case of non-resident FD holders tax shall be deducted at source as per the provisions of section 195 of
                        Income Tax Act, 1961. <br>
